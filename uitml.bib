 abstract = {Identifying customer segments in retail banking portfolios with different risk profiles can improve the accuracy of credit scoring. The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has shown promising results in different research domains, and it has been documented the powerful information embedded in the latent space of the VAE. We use the VAE and show that transforming the input data into a meaningful representation, it is possible to steer configurations in the latent space of the VAE. Specifically, the Weight of Evidence (WoE) transformation encapsulates the propensity to fall into financial distress and the latent space in the VAE preserves this characteristic in a well-defined clustering structure. These clusters have considerably different risk profiles and therefore are suitable not only for credit scoring but also for marketing and customer purposes. This new clustering methodology offers solutions to some of the challenges in the existing clustering algorithms, e.g., suggests the number of clusters, assigns cluster labels to new customers, enables cluster visualization, scales to large datasets, captures non-linear relationships among others. Finally, for portfolios with a large number of customers in each cluster, developing one classifier model per cluster can improve the credit scoring assessment.},

 abstract = {Learning data representations that reflect the customers' creditworthiness can improve marketing campaigns, customer relationship management, data and process management or the credit risk assessment in retail banks. In this research, we adopt the Variational Autoencoder (VAE), which has the ability to learn latent representations that contain useful information. We show that it is possible to steer the latent representations in the latent space of the VAE using the Weight of Evidence and forming a specific grouping of the data that reflects the customers' creditworthiness. Our proposed method learns a latent representation of the data, which shows a well-defied clustering structure capturing the customers' creditworthiness. These clusters are well suited for the aforementioned banks' activities. Further, our methodology generalizes to new customers, captures high-dimensional and complex financial data, and scales to large data sets.},

Based on international literature and practical experience within the group, a comprehensive standardized test protocol was developed.ResultsThe proposed protocol includes tests related to the mechanical functionality, X-ray tube, detector, and image quality for CT scanners. For each test, recommendations regarding the purpose, equipment needed, an outline of the test method, the measured parameter, tolerance levels, and the testing frequency are stated. In addition, a number of optional tests are briefly discussed that may provide further information about the CT system.ConclusionBased on international references and medical physicists' practical experiences, a comprehensive QA protocol for CT systems is proposed, including both acceptance and constancy tests. The protocol may serve as a reference for medical physicists in the Nordic countries.},

 abstract = {This paper presents an automatic image segmentation method for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data. It utilizes the full polarimetric information and incorporates texture by modeling with a non-Gaussian distribution for the complex scattering coefficients. The modeling is based upon the well-known product model, with a Gamma-distributed texture parameter leading to the K-Wishart model for the covariance matrix. The automatic clustering is achieved through a finite mixture model estimated with a modified expectation maximization algorithm. We include an additional goodness-of-fit test stage that allows for splitting and merging of clusters. This not only improves the model fit of the clusters, but also dynamically selects the appropriate number of clusters. The resulting image segmentation depicts the statistically significant clusters within the image. A key feature is that the degree of sub-sampling of the input image will affect the detail level of the clustering, revealing only the major classes or a variable level of detail. Real-world examples are shown to demonstrate the technique.},

 abstract = {The precise physiological effects of antidepressant drugs, and in particular their actions at non-monoamine transporter targets, are largely unknown. We have recently identified the tricyclic antidepressant drug desipramine (DMI) as a direct ligand at the ?? 2A adrenergic receptor (AR) without itself driving heterotrimeric G protein/downstream effector activation [5]. In this study, we report our novel finding that DMI modulates ?? 2AAR signaling in response to the endogenous agonist norepinephrine (NE). DMI acted as a signaling potentiator, selectively enhancing NE-induced ?? 2AAR-mediated ERK1/2 MAPK signaling. This potentiation of ERK1/2 activation was observed as an increase in NE response sensitivity and a prolongation of the activation kinetics. DMI in a physiologically relevant ratio with NE effectively turned on ERK1/2 signaling that is lacking in response to physiological NE alone. Further, the DMI-induced ERK1/2 potentiation relied on heterotrimeric G i/o proteins and was arrestin-independent. This modulatory effect of DMI on NE signaling provides novel insight into the effects of this antidepressant drug on the noradrenergic system which it regulates, insight which enhances our understanding of the therapeutic mechanism for DMI. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

 abstract = {This paper addresses estimation of the equivalent number of looks (ENL), an important parameter in statistical modeling of multilook synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Two new ENL estimators are discovered by looking at certain moments of the multilook polarimetric covariance matrix, which is commonly used to represent multilook polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data, and assuming that the covariance matrix is complex Wishart distributed. First, a second-order trace moment provides a polarimetric extension of the ENL definition and also a matrix-variate version of the conventional ENL estimator. The second estimator is obtained from the log-determinant matrix moment and is also shown to be the maximum likelihood estimator under the Wishart model. It proves to have much lower variance than any other known ENL estimator, whether applied to single-polarization or PolSAR data. Moreover, this estimator is less affected by texture and thus provides more accurate results than other estimators should the assumption of Gaussian statistics for the complex scattering coefficients be violated. These are the first known estimators to use the full covariance matrix as input, rather than individual intensity channels, and therefore to utilize all the statistical information available. We finally demonstrate how an ENL estimate can be computed automatically from the empirical density of small sample estimates calculated over a whole scene. We show that this method is more robust than procedures where the estimate is calculated in a manually selected region of interest.},

Our starting point is to demonstrate that the scale mixture of Gaussian (SMoG) distribu- tion model is suitable for modeling PolSAR data. We show that the distribution of the sample covariance matrix for the SMoG model is given as a generalization of the Wishart distribution and present this expression in integral form. We then derive the closed-form solution for one particular SMoG distribution, which is known as the multivariateK-distribution. Based on this new distribution for the sample covariance matrix, termed as the K-Wishart distribution, we propose a Bayesian classification scheme, which can be used in both supervised and unsupervised modes. To demonstrate the effect of including non-Gaussianity, we present a detailed comparisonwith the standardWishart classifier using airborne EMISAR data.},

Based on the matrix-variate Mellin transform, an alternative characteristic function is defined, from which we can retrieve a new kind of matrix log-moments and log-cumulants.

Change detection in heterogeneous multitemporal satellite images is a challenging and still not much studied topic in remote sensing and earth observation. This paper focuses on comparison of image pairs covering the same geographical area and acquired by two different sensors, one optical radiometer and one synthetic aperture radar, at two different times. We propose a clustering-based technique to detect changes, identified as clusters that split or merge in the different images. To evaluate potentials and limitations of our method, we perform experiments on real data. Preliminary results confirm the relationship between splits and merges of clusters and the occurrence of changes. However, it becomes evident that it is necessary to incorporate prior, ancillary, or application-specific information to improve the interpretation of clustering results and to identify unambiguously the areas of change.},

 abstract = {The free text in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) conveys a huge amount of clinical information about health state and patient history. Despite a rapidly growing literature on the use of machine learning techniques for extracting this information, little effort has been invested towards feature selection and the features' corresponding medical interpretation. In this work, we focus on the task of early detection of anastomosis leakage (AL), a severe complication after elective surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery, using free text extracted from EHRs. We use a Bag-of-Words model to investigate the potential for feature selection strategies. The purpose is earlier detection of AL and prediction of AL with data generated in the EHR before the actual complication occur. Due to the high dimensionality of the data, we derive feature selection strategies using the robust support vector machine linear maximum margin classifier, by investigating: (a) a simple statistical criterion (leave-oneout based test); (b) an intensive-computation statistical criterion (Bootstrap resampling); and (c) an advanced statistical criterion (kernel entropy). Results reveal a discriminatory power for early detection of complications after CRC (sensitivity 100%; specificity 72%). These results can be used to develop prediction models, based on EHR data, that can support surgeons and patients in the preoperative decision making phase.},

 abstract = {Autoencoders learn data representations (codes) in such a way that the input is reproduced at the output of the network. However, it is not always clear what kind of properties of the input data need to be captured by the codes. Kernel machines have experienced great success by operating via inner-products in a theoretically well-defined reproducing kernel Hilbert space, hence capturing topological properties of input data. In this paper, we enhance the autoencoder's ability to learn effective data representations by aligning inner products between codes with respect to a kernel matrix. By doing so, the proposed kernelized autoencoder allows learning similarity-preserving embeddings of input data, where the notion of similarity is explicitly controlled by the user and encoded in a positive semi-definite kernel matrix. Experiments are performed for evaluating both reconstruction and kernel alignment performance in classification tasks and visualization of high-dimensional data. Additionally, we show that our method is capable to emulate kernel principal component analysis on a denoising task, obtaining competitive results at a much lower computational cost.},

 abstract = {Similarity-based approaches represent a promising direction for time series analysis. However, many such methods rely on parameter tuning, and some have shortcomings if the time series are multivariate (MTS), due to dependencies between attributes, or the time series contain missing data. In this paper, we address these challenges within the powerful context of kernel methods by proposing the robust time series cluster kernel (TCK). The approach taken leverages the missing data handling properties of Gaussian mixture models (GMM) augmented with informative prior distributions. An ensemble learning approach is exploited to ensure robustness to parameters by combining the clustering results of many GMM to form the final kernel. We evaluate the TCK on synthetic and real data and compare to other state-of-the-art techniques. The experimental results demonstrate that the TCK is robust to parameter choices, provides competitive results for MTS without missing data and outstanding results for missing data.},

The method consists in projecting the output of the internal layer of the network on a space with lower dimensionality, before training the output layer to learn the target task. Notably, we enforce a regularization constraint that leads to better generalization capabilities. We evaluate the performances of our approach on several benchmark tests, using different techniques to train the readout of the network, achieving superior predictive performance when using the proposed framework. Finally, we provide an insight on the effectiveness of the implemented mechanics through a visualization of the trajectory in the phase space and relying on the methodologies of nonlinear time-series analysis. By applying our method on well known chaotic systems, we provide evidence that the lower dimensional embedding retains the dynamical properties of the underlying system better than the full-dimensional internal states of the network.},

As opposed to supervised deep learning, this line of research is in its infancy, and how to design and optimize suitable loss functions to train deep neural networks for clustering is still an open question. Our contribution to this emerging field is a new deep clustering network that leverages the discriminative power of information-theoretic divergence measures, which have been shown to be effective in traditional clustering. We propose a novel loss function that incorporates geometric regularization constraints, thus avoiding degenerate structures of the resulting clustering partition. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real datasets show that the proposed network achieves competitive performance with respect to other state-of-the-art methods, scales well to large datasets, and does not require pre-training steps.},

 abstract = {Noisy labeled data represent a rich source of information that often are easily accessible and cheap to obtain, but label noise might also have many negative consequences if not accounted for. How to fully utilize noisy labels has been studied extensively within the framework of standard supervised machine learning over a period of several decades. However, very little research has been conducted on solving the challenge posed by noisy labels in non-standard settings. This includes situations where only a fraction of the samples are labeled (semi-supervised) and each high-dimensional sample is associated with multiple labels. In this work, we present a novel semi-supervised and multi-label dimensionality reduction method that effectively utilizes information from both noisy multi-labels and unlabeled data. With the proposed Noisy multi-label semi-supervised dimensionality reduction (NMLSDR) method, the noisy multi-labels are denoised and unlabeled data are labeled simultaneously via a specially designed label propagation algorithm. NMLSDR then learns a projection matrix for reducing the dimensionality by maximizing the dependence between the enlarged and denoised multi-label space and the features in the projected space. Extensive experiments on synthetic data, benchmark datasets, as well as a real-world case study, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art multi-label feature extraction algorithms.},

Change detection in heterogeneous multitemporal satellite images is a challenging and still not much studied topic in remote sensing and earth observation. This paper focuses on comparison of image pairs covering the same geographical area and acquired by two different sensors, one optical radiometer and one synthetic aperture radar, at two different times. We propose a clustering-based technique to detect changes, identified as clusters that split or merge in the different images. To evaluate potentials and limitations of our method, we perform experiments on real data. Preliminary results confirm the relationship between splits and merges of clusters and the occurrence of changes. However, it becomes evident that it is necessary to incorporate prior, ancillary, or application-specific information to improve the interpretation of clustering results and to identify unambiguously the areas of change.},

 abstract = {This letter discusses the potential of automatic ship detection in ice-infested waters based on satellite synthetic aper- ture radar (SAR) imagery. The popularK-distribution is used to model the backscatter statistics of sea ice clutter. The goodness of fit of this model is assessed with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Anderson–Darling test statistics for both VV and VH polar- izations. We also test the impact of introducing the Method of Log Cumulant (MoLC) estimator for the shape parameter of the K-distribution. Finally, a constant false-alarm rate ship detection algorithm, applying theK-distribution with the MoLC estimator, is evaluated on dual-polarization RADARSAT-2 SAR data. Our results demonstrate that this is a viable approach to ship detection in ice-infested waters.},

However, standardized QA protocols do not yet exist and the QA methods, as well as the applied tolerance levels, vary in scope and extent at different hospitals.PurposeTo propose a standardized protocol for acceptance and constancy testing of CT scanners in the Nordic Region.Material and MethodsFollowing a Nordic Association for Clinical Physics (NACP) initiative, a group of medical physicists, with representatives from four Nordic countries, was formed. Based on international literature and practical experience within the group, a comprehensive standardized test protocol was developed.ResultsThe proposed protocol includes tests related to the mechanical functionality, X-ray tube, detector, and image quality for CT scanners. For each test, recommendations regarding the purpose, equipment needed, an outline of the test method, the measured parameter, tolerance levels, and the testing frequency are stated. In addition, a number of optional tests are briefly discussed that may provide further information about the CT system.ConclusionBased on international references and medical physicists' practical experiences, a comprehensive QA protocol for CT systems is proposed, including both acceptance and constancy tests. The protocol may serve as a reference for medical physicists in the Nordic countries.},

 abstract = {Given an object of interest that evolves in time, one often wants to detect possible changes in its properties. The first changes may be small and occur in different scales and it may be crucial to detect them as early as possible. Examples include identification of potentially malignant changes in skin moles or the gradual onset of food quality deterioration. Statistical scale-space methodologies can be very useful in such situations since exploring the measurements in multiple resolutions can help identify even subtle changes. We extend a recently proposed scale-space methodology to a technique that successfully detects such small changes and at the same time keeps false alarms at a very low level. The potential of the novel methodology is first demonstrated with hyperspectral skin mole data artificially distorted to include a very small change. Our real data application considers hyperspectral images used for food quality detection. In these experiments the performance of the proposed method is either superior or on par with a standard approach such as principal component analysis.},

Motivated by the zoom-in operation of a pathologist using a digital microscope, RAZN learns a policy network to decide whether zooming is required in a given region of interest. Because the zoom-in action is selective, RAZN is robust to unbalanced and noisy ground truth labels and can efficiently reduce overfitting. We evaluate our method on a public breast cancer dataset. RAZN outperforms both single-scale and multi-scale baseline approaches, achieving better accuracy at low inference cost.},

Manual measurement of CTR is time-consuming and can be affected by human subjectivity, making it desirable to design computer-aided systems that assist clinicians in the diagnosis process.

The framework learns domain invariant feature representations from openly available data sources to produce accurate chest organ segmentation for unlabeled datasets.

 abstract = {Salient segmentation aims to segment out attention-grabbing regions, a critical yet challenging task and the foundation of many high-level computer vision applications. It requires semantic-aware grouping of pixels into salient regions and benefits from the utilization of global multi-scale contexts to achieve good local reasoning. Previous works often address it as two-class segmentation problems utilizing complicated multi-step procedures including refinement networks and complex graphical models. We argue that semantic salient segmentation can instead be effectively resolved by reformulating it as a simple yet intuitive pixel-pair based connectivity prediction task. Following the intuition that salient objects can be naturally grouped via semantic-aware connectivity between neighboring pixels, we propose a pure Connectivity Net (ConnNet). ConnNet predicts connectivity probabilities of each pixel with its neighboring pixels by leveraging multi-level cascade contexts embedded in the image and long-range pixel relations. We investigate our approach on two tasks, namely salient object segmentation and salient instance-level segmentation, and illustrate that improvements can be obtained by modeling these tasks as connectivity instead of binary segmentation tasks. We achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming or being comparable to existing approaches while reducing training time due to our less complex approach.},

 abstract = {This paper presents an automatic image segmentation method for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data. It utilizes the full polarimetric information and incorporates texture by modeling with a non-Gaussian distribution for the complex scattering coefficients. The modeling is based upon the well-known product model, with a Gamma-distributed texture parameter leading to the K-Wishart model for the covariance matrix. The automatic clustering is achieved through a finite mixture model estimated with a modified expectation maximization algorithm. We include an additional goodness-of-fit test stage that allows for splitting and merging of clusters. This not only improves the model fit of the clusters, but also dynamically selects the appropriate number of clusters. The resulting image segmentation depicts the statistically significant clusters within the image. A key feature is that the degree of sub-sampling of the input image will affect the detail level of the clustering, revealing only the major classes or a variable level of detail. Real-world examples are shown to demonstrate the technique.},

 abstract = {The precise physiological effects of antidepressant drugs, and in particular their actions at non-monoamine transporter targets, are largely unknown. We have recently identified the tricyclic antidepressant drug desipramine (DMI) as a direct ligand at the ?? 2A adrenergic receptor (AR) without itself driving heterotrimeric G protein/downstream effector activation [5]. In this study, we report our novel finding that DMI modulates ?? 2AAR signaling in response to the endogenous agonist norepinephrine (NE). DMI acted as a signaling potentiator, selectively enhancing NE-induced ?? 2AAR-mediated ERK1/2 MAPK signaling. This potentiation of ERK1/2 activation was observed as an increase in NE response sensitivity and a prolongation of the activation kinetics. DMI in a physiologically relevant ratio with NE effectively turned on ERK1/2 signaling that is lacking in response to physiological NE alone. Further, the DMI-induced ERK1/2 potentiation relied on heterotrimeric G i/o proteins and was arrestin-independent. This modulatory effect of DMI on NE signaling provides novel insight into the effects of this antidepressant drug on the noradrenergic system which it regulates, insight which enhances our understanding of the therapeutic mechanism for DMI. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

 abstract = {This paper addresses estimation of the equivalent number of looks (ENL), an important parameter in statistical modeling of multilook synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Two new ENL estimators are discovered by looking at certain moments of the multilook polarimetric covariance matrix, which is commonly used to represent multilook polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data, and assuming that the covariance matrix is complex Wishart distributed. First, a second-order trace moment provides a polarimetric extension of the ENL definition and also a matrix-variate version of the conventional ENL estimator. The second estimator is obtained from the log-determinant matrix moment and is also shown to be the maximum likelihood estimator under the Wishart model. It proves to have much lower variance than any other known ENL estimator, whether applied to single-polarization or PolSAR data. Moreover, this estimator is less affected by texture and thus provides more accurate results than other estimators should the assumption of Gaussian statistics for the complex scattering coefficients be violated. These are the first known estimators to use the full covariance matrix as input, rather than individual intensity channels, and therefore to utilize all the statistical information available. We finally demonstrate how an ENL estimate can be computed automatically from the empirical density of small sample estimates calculated over a whole scene. We show that this method is more robust than procedures where the estimate is calculated in a manually selected region of interest.},

 abstract = {The contribution of this paper is to provide a new input space analysis of the properties of sum-of-squared-error K-means clustering performed in a Mercer kernel feature space. Such an analysis has been missing until now, even though kernel K-means has been popular in the clustering literature. Our derivation extends the theory of traditional K-means from properties of mean vectors to information theoretic properties of Parzen window estimated probability density functions (pdfs). In particular, Euclidean distance-based kernel K-means is shown to maximize an integrated squared error divergence measure between cluster pdfs and the overall pdf of the data, while a cosine similarity-based approach maximizes a Cauchy-Schwarz divergence measure. Furthermore, the iterative rules which assign data points to clusters in order to maximize these criteria are shown to depend on the cluster pdfs evaluated at the data points, in addition to the Renyi entropies of the clusters. The Bayes rule is shown to be a special case. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {This paper contributes a tutorial level discussion of some interesting properties of the recent Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence measure between probability density functions. This measure brings together elements from several different machine learning fields, namely information theory, graph theory and Mercer kernel and spectral theory. These connections are revealed when estimating the CS divergence non-parametrically using the Parzen window technique for density estimation. An important consequence of these connections is that they enhance our understanding of the different machine learning schemes relative to each other. © 2006 The Franklin Institute.},

 abstract = {In recent years there has been a growing interest in clustering methods stemming from the spectral decomposition of the data affinity matrix, which are shown to present good results on a wide variety of situations. However, a complete theoretical understanding of these methods in terms of data distributions is not yet well understood. In this paper, we propose a spectral clustering based mode merging method for mean shift as a theoretically well-founded approach that enables a probabilistic interpretation of affinity based clustering through kernel density estimation. This connection also allows principled kernel optimization and enables the use of anisotropic variable-size kernels to match local data structures. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm's performance on image segmentation applications and compare its clustering results with the well-known Mean Shift and Normalized Cut algorithms. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {Given an object of interest that evolves in time, one often wants to detect possible changes in its properties. The first changes may be small and occur in different scales and it may be crucial to detect them as early as possible. Examples include identification of potentially malignant changes in skin moles or the gradual onset of food quality deterioration. Statistical scale-space methodologies can be very useful in such situations since exploring the measurements in multiple resolutions can help identify even subtle changes. We extend a recently proposed scale-space methodology to a technique that successfully detects such small changes and at the same time keeps false alarms at a very low level. The potential of the novel methodology is first demonstrated with hyperspectral skin mole data artificially distorted to include a very small change. Our real data application considers hyperspectral images used for food quality detection. In these experiments the performance of the proposed method is either superior or on par with a standard approach such as principal component analysis.},

 abstract = {The free text in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) conveys a huge amount of clinical information about health state and patient history. Despite a rapidly growing literature on the use of machine learning techniques for extracting this information, little effort has been invested towards feature selection and the features' corresponding medical interpretation. In this work, we focus on the task of early detection of anastomosis leakage (AL), a severe complication after elective surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery, using free text extracted from EHRs. We use a Bag-of-Words model to investigate the potential for feature selection strategies. The purpose is earlier detection of AL and prediction of AL with data generated in the EHR before the actual complication occur. Due to the high dimensionality of the data, we derive feature selection strategies using the robust support vector machine linear maximum margin classifier, by investigating: (a) a simple statistical criterion (leave-oneout based test); (b) an intensive-computation statistical criterion (Bootstrap resampling); and (c) an advanced statistical criterion (kernel entropy). Results reveal a discriminatory power for early detection of complications after CRC (sensitivity 100%; specificity 72%). These results can be used to develop prediction models, based on EHR data, that can support surgeons and patients in the preoperative decision making phase.},

 abstract = {Physical activities have a significant impact on blood glucose homeostasis of patients with type 1 diabetes. Regular physical exercise provides many proven health benefits and is recommended as part of a healthy lifestyle. However, one of the main side effects of physical activities is hypoglycemia (low blood glucose). Fear of hypoglycemia generally leads to the patients not participating in physical activities. This paper shows a proof of concept that machine learning can be used to create a personalized food recommendation system for patients with type 1 diabetes. Machine learning algorithms were designed to improve glycemic control and reduce the overcompensation of carbohydrate. First, a personalized model based on feedforward neural networks is developed to predict the blood glucose outcome during and after physical activities. Based on the personalized model and reinforcement learning, optimal food intakes will be recommended to the patient. Simulation results show that the proposed methodology has successfully maintained the blood glucose in the healthy range on a type 1 diabetes simulator during physical activities.},

Our algorithm has several advantages compared to many other graph-based methods in terms of determining an appropriate affinity measure, computational complexity, memory requirements and coping with different data scales.

 abstract = {The free text in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) conveys a huge amount of clinical information about health state and patient history. Despite a rapidly growing literature on the use of machine learning techniques for extracting this information, little effort has been invested towards feature selection and the features' corresponding medical interpretation. In this work, we focus on the task of early detection of anastomosis leakage (AL), a severe complication after elective surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery, using free text extracted from EHRs. We use a Bag-of-Words model to investigate the potential for feature selection strategies. The purpose is earlier detection of AL and prediction of AL with data generated in the EHR before the actual complication occur. Due to the high dimensionality of the data, we derive feature selection strategies using the robust support vector machine linear maximum margin classifier, by investigating: (a) a simple statistical criterion (leave-oneout based test); (b) an intensive-computation statistical criterion (Bootstrap resampling); and (c) an advanced statistical criterion (kernel entropy). Results reveal a discriminatory power for early detection of complications after CRC (sensitivity 100%; specificity 72%). These results can be used to develop prediction models, based on EHR data, that can support surgeons and patients in the preoperative decision making phase.},

 abstract = {The contribution of this paper is to provide a new input space analysis of the properties of sum-of-squared-error K-means clustering performed in a Mercer kernel feature space. Such an analysis has been missing until now, even though kernel K-means has been popular in the clustering literature. Our derivation extends the theory of traditional K-means from properties of mean vectors to information theoretic properties of Parzen window estimated probability density functions (pdfs). In particular, Euclidean distance-based kernel K-means is shown to maximize an integrated squared error divergence measure between cluster pdfs and the overall pdf of the data, while a cosine similarity-based approach maximizes a Cauchy-Schwarz divergence measure. Furthermore, the iterative rules which assign data points to clusters in order to maximize these criteria are shown to depend on the cluster pdfs evaluated at the data points, in addition to the Renyi entropies of the clusters. The Bayes rule is shown to be a special case. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {We propose a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for land cover mapping in remote sensing images, with a focus on urban areas. In remote sensing, class im-balance represents often a problem for tasks like land cover mapping, as small objects get less prioritised in an effort to achieve the best overall accuracy. We propose a novel ap-proach to achieve high overall accuracy, while still achiev-ing good accuracy for small objects. Quantifying the uncer-tainty on a pixel scale is another challenge in remote sens-ing, especially when using CNNs. In this paper we use re-cent advances in measuring uncertainty for CNNs and eval-uate their quality both qualitatively and quantitatively in a remote sensing context. We demonstrate our ideas on differ-ent deep architectures including patch-based and so-called pixel-to-pixel approaches, as well as their combination, by classifying each pixel in a set of aerial images covering Vai-hingen, Germany. The results show that we obtain an over-all classification accuracy of 87%. The corresponding F1-score for the small object class " car " is 80.6%, which is higher than state-of-the art for this dataset.},

 abstract = {To maintain the reliability, availability, and sustainability of electricity supply, electricity companies regularly perform visual inspections on their transmission and distribution networks. These inspections have been typically carried out using foot patrol and/or helicopter-assisted methods to plan for necessary repair or replacement works before any major damage, which may cause power outage. This solution is quite slow, expensive, and potentially dangerous. In recent years, numerous researches have been conducted to automate the visual inspections by using automated helicopters, flying robots, and/or climbing robots. However, due to the high accuracy requirements of the task and its unique challenges, automatic vision-based inspection has not been widely adopted. In this paper, with the aim of providing a good starting point for researchers who are interested in developing a fully automatic autonomous vision-based power line inspection system, we conduct an extensive literature review. First, we examine existing power line inspection methods with special attention paid to highlight their advantages and disadvantages. Next, we summarize well-suited tasks and review potential data sources for automatic vision-based inspection. Then, we survey existing automatic vision-based power line inspection systems. Based on that, we propose a new automatic autonomous vision-based power line inspection concept that uses Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) inspection as the main inspection method, optical images as the primary data source, and deep learning as the backbone of data analysis and inspection. Then, we present an overview of possibilities and challenges of deep vision (deep learning for computer vision) approaches for both UAV navigation and UAV inspection and discuss possible solutions to the challenges. Finally, we conclude the paper with an outlook for the future of this field and propose potential next steps for implementing the concept.},

 abstract = {Autoencoders learn data representations (codes) in such a way that the input is reproduced at the output of the network. However, it is not always clear what kind of properties of the input data need to be captured by the codes. Kernel machines have experienced great success by operating via inner-products in a theoretically well-defined reproducing kernel Hilbert space, hence capturing topological properties of input data. In this paper, we enhance the autoencoder's ability to learn effective data representations by aligning inner products between codes with respect to a kernel matrix. By doing so, the proposed kernelized autoencoder allows learning similarity-preserving embeddings of input data, where the notion of similarity is explicitly controlled by the user and encoded in a positive semi-definite kernel matrix. Experiments are performed for evaluating both reconstruction and kernel alignment performance in classification tasks and visualization of high-dimensional data. Additionally, we show that our method is capable to emulate kernel principal component analysis on a denoising task, obtaining competitive results at a much lower computational cost.},

 abstract = {Clinical measurements that can be represented as time series constitute an important fraction of the electronic health records and are often both uncertain and incomplete. Recurrent neural networks are a special class of neural networks that are particularly suitable to process time series data but, in their original formulation, cannot explicitly deal with missing data. In this paper, we explore imputation strategies for handling missing values in classifiers based on recurrent neural network (RNN) and apply a recently proposed recurrent architecture, the Gated Recurrent Unit with Decay, specifically designed to handle missing data. We focus on the problem of detecting surgical site infection in patients by analyzing time series of their blood sample measurements and we compare the results obtained with different RNN-based classifiers.},

 abstract = {Similarity-based approaches represent a promising direction for time series analysis. However, many such methods rely on parameter tuning, and some have shortcomings if the time series are multivariate (MTS), due to dependencies between attributes, or the time series contain missing data. In this paper, we address these challenges within the powerful context of kernel methods by proposing the robust time series cluster kernel (TCK). The approach taken leverages the missing data handling properties of Gaussian mixture models (GMM) augmented with informative prior distributions. An ensemble learning approach is exploited to ensure robustness to parameters by combining the clustering results of many GMM to form the final kernel. We evaluate the TCK on synthetic and real data and compare to other state-of-the-art techniques. The experimental results demonstrate that the TCK is robust to parameter choices, provides competitive results for MTS without missing data and outstanding results for missing data.},

The method consists in projecting the output of the internal layer of the network on a space with lower dimensionality, before training the output layer to learn the target task. Notably, we enforce a regularization constraint that leads to better generalization capabilities. We evaluate the performances of our approach on several benchmark tests, using different techniques to train the readout of the network, achieving superior predictive performance when using the proposed framework. Finally, we provide an insight on the effectiveness of the implemented mechanics through a visualization of the trajectory in the phase space and relying on the methodologies of nonlinear time-series analysis. By applying our method on well known chaotic systems, we provide evidence that the lower dimensional embedding retains the dynamical properties of the underlying system better than the full-dimensional internal states of the network.},

 abstract = {The free text in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) conveys a huge amount of clinical information about health state and patient history. Despite a rapidly growing literature on the use of machine learning techniques for extracting this information, little effort has been invested towards feature selection and the features' corresponding medical interpretation. In this work, we focus on the task of early detection of anastomosis leakage (AL), a severe complication after elective surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery, using free text extracted from EHRs. We use a Bag-of-Words model to investigate the potential for feature selection strategies. The purpose is earlier detection of AL and prediction of AL with data generated in the EHR before the actual complication occur. Due to the high dimensionality of the data, we derive feature selection strategies using the robust support vector machine linear maximum margin classifier, by investigating: (a) a simple statistical criterion (leave-oneout based test); (b) an intensive-computation statistical criterion (Bootstrap resampling); and (c) an advanced statistical criterion (kernel entropy). Results reveal a discriminatory power for early detection of complications after CRC (sensitivity 100%; specificity 72%). These results can be used to develop prediction models, based on EHR data, that can support surgeons and patients in the preoperative decision making phase.},

 abstract = {© 2017 IEEE. The density ridge framework for estimating principal curves and surfaces has in a number of recent works been shown to capture manifold structure in data in an intuitive and effective manner. However, to date there exists no efficient way to traverse these manifolds as defined by density ridges. This is unfortunate, as manifold traversal is an important problem for example for shape estimation in medical imaging, or in general for being able to characterize and understand state transitions or local variability over the data manifold. In this paper, we remedy this situation by introducing a novel manifold traversal algorithm based on geodesics within the density ridge approach. The traversal is executed in a subspace capturing the intrinsic dimensionality of the data using dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis or kernel entropy component analysis. A mapping back to the ambient space is obtained by training a neural network. We compare against maximum mean discrepancy traversal, a recent approach, and obtain promising results.},

Kernel ECA reveals structure relating to the Renyi entropy of the input space data set, estimated via a kernel matrix using Parzen windowing. This is achieved by projections onto a subset of entropy preserving kernel principal component analysis (kernel PCA) axes. This subset needs not in general to correspond to the top eigenvalues of the kernel matrix, in contrast to dimensionality reduction using kernel PCA. We show that kernel ECA may produce strikingly different trans- formed data sets compared to kernel PCA, with a distinct angle- based structure. A new spectral clustering algorithm utilizing this structure is developed with positive results. Furthermore, kernel ECA is shown to be an useful alternative for pattern denoising.},

Given labeled data, algorithms such as support vector machines (SVMs) or projection methods such as Fisher discriminant analysis may be executed in the feature space. For unsupervised dimensionality reduction in the feature space, the most common approach is to perform principal component analysis (PCA) in that space, thus maximally capturing the variability of the feature space data, however, doing so without necessarily capturing any cluster structure in the data. In this tutorial, we review the theory behind feature space mapping and review recent advances that broaden the understanding and interpretability of the mapping in terms of a key input space quantity, particularly the quadratic Renyi entropy of the data via the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a psd convolution operator. Focusing on the unsupervised case, we describe the identification of entropy-relevant dimensions in the feature space. We review recent results showing that these dimensions capture structure in the data in the form of clusters, and that they are, in general, different from the kernel PCA (KPCA) dimensions. Differences between these approaches to dimensionality reduction for visualization and clustering are illustrated.},

 abstract = {Automatic urban land cover classification is a fundamental problem in remote sensing, e.g. for environmental monitoring. The problem is highly challenging, as classes generally have high inter-class and low intra-class variance. Techniques to improve urban land cover classification performance in remote sensing include fusion of data from different sensors with different data modalities. However, such techniques require all modalities to be available to the classifier in the decision-making process, i.e. at test time, as well as in training. If a data modality is missing at test time, current state-of-the-art approaches have in general no procedure available for exploiting information from these modalities. This represents a waste of potentially useful information. We propose as a remedy a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for urban land cover classification which is able to embed all available training modalities in a so-called hallucination network. The network will in effect replace missing data modalities in the test phase, enabling fusion capabilities even when data modalities are missing in testing. We demonstrate the method using two datasets consisting of optical and digital surface model (DSM) images. We simulate missing modalities by assuming that DSM images are missing during testing. Our method outperforms both standard CNNs trained only on optical images as well as an ensemble of two standard CNNs. We further evaluate the potential of our method to handle situations where only some DSM images are missing during testing. Overall, we show that we can clearly exploit training time information of the missing modality during testing.},

Our contribution to this emerging field is a new deep clustering network that leverages the discriminative power of information-theoretic divergence measures, which have been shown to be effective in traditional clustering.

 abstract = {Noisy labeled data represent a rich source of information that often are easily accessible and cheap to obtain, but label noise might also have many negative consequences if not accounted for. How to fully utilize noisy labels has been studied extensively within the framework of standard supervised machine learning over a period of several decades. However, very little research has been conducted on solving the challenge posed by noisy labels in non-standard settings. This includes situations where only a fraction of the samples are labeled (semi-supervised) and each high-dimensional sample is associated with multiple labels. In this work, we present a novel semi-supervised and multi-label dimensionality reduction method that effectively utilizes information from both noisy multi-labels and unlabeled data. With the proposed Noisy multi-label semi-supervised dimensionality reduction (NMLSDR) method, the noisy multi-labels are denoised and unlabeled data are labeled simultaneously via a specially designed label propagation algorithm. NMLSDR then learns a projection matrix for reducing the dimensionality by maximizing the dependence between the enlarged and denoised multi-label space and the features in the projected space. Extensive experiments on synthetic data, benchmark datasets, as well as a real-world case study, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art multi-label feature extraction algorithms.},

Recently, the concept of an information plane (coupled with the famed information bottleneck principle) began to shed light on the analysis of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). We provided an in-depth insight into stacked autoencoders (SAEs) using a novel matrix-based Renyi's \alpha-entropy functional, enabling for the first time the analysis of the dynamics of learning using information flow in the real-world scenario involving complex network architecture and large data. Despite the great potential of these past works, there are several open questions when it comes to applying information theoretic concepts to understand convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These include for instance the accurate estimation of information quantities among multiple variables, and the many different training methodologies. By extending the novel matrix-based Renyi's \alpha-entropy functional to a multivariate scenario and introducing the partial information decomposition (PID) framework, this paper presents a systematic method to analyze CNNs training using information theory. Our results validate two fundamental data processing inequalities in CNNs, and also reveals some fundamental issues embedded in the training phase of CNNs.},

The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has shown promising results in different research domains, and it has been documented the powerful information embedded in the latent space of the VAE. We use the VAE and show that transforming the input data into a meaningful representation, it is possible to steer configurations in the latent space of the VAE. Specifically, the Weight of Evidence (WoE) transformation encapsulates the propensity to fall into financial distress and the latent space in the VAE preserves this characteristic in a well-defined clustering structure. These clusters have considerably different risk profiles and therefore are suitable not only for credit scoring but also for marketing and customer purposes. This new clustering methodology offers solutions to some of the challenges in the existing clustering algorithms, e.g., suggests the number of clusters, assigns cluster labels to new customers, enables cluster visualization, scales to large datasets, captures non-linear relationships among others. Finally, for portfolios with a large number of customers in each cluster, developing one classifier model per cluster can improve the credit scoring assessment.},

 abstract = {We propose a network for semantic mapping called the Dense Dilated Convolutions Merging Network (DDCM-Net) to provide a deep learning approach that can recognize multi-scale and complex shaped objects with similar color and textures, such as buildings, surfaces/roads, and trees in very high resolution remote sensing images. The proposed DDCM-Net consists of dense dilated convolutions merged with varying dilation rates. This can effectively enlarge the kernels' receptive fields, and, more importantly, obtain fused local and global context information to promote surrounding discriminative capability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DDCM-Net on the publicly available ISPRS Potsdam dataset and achieve a performance of 92.3% F1-score and 86.0% mean intersection over union accuracy by only using the RGB bands, without any post-processing. We also show results on the ISPRS Vaihingen dataset, where the DDCM-Net trained with IRRG bands, also obtained better mapping accuracy (89.8% F1-score) than previous state-of-the-art approaches.},

 abstract = {Foraminifera are single-celled marine organisms, which may have a planktic or benthic lifestyle. During their life cycle they construct shells consisting of one or more chambers, and these shells remain as fossils in marine sediments. Classifying and counting these fossils have become an important tool in e.g. oceanography and climatology. Currently the process of identifying and counting microfossils is performed manually using a microscope and is very time consuming. Developing methods to automate this process is therefore considered important across a range of research fields. The first steps towards developing a deep learning model that can detect and classify microscopic foraminifera are proposed. The proposed model is based on a VGG16 model that has been pretrained on the ImageNet dataset, and adapted to the foraminifera task using transfer learning. Additionally, a novel image dataset consisting of microscopic foraminifera and sediments from the Barents Sea region is introduced.},

 abstract = {Given an object of interest that evolves in time, one often wants to detect possible changes in its properties. The first changes may be small and occur in different scales and it may be crucial to detect them as early as possible. Examples include identification of potentially malignant changes in skin moles or the gradual onset of food quality deterioration. Statistical scale-space methodologies can be very useful in such situations since exploring the measurements in multiple resolutions can help identify even subtle changes. We extend a recently proposed scale-space methodology to a technique that successfully detects such small changes and at the same time keeps false alarms at a very low level. The potential of the novel methodology is first demonstrated with hyperspectral skin mole data artificially distorted to include a very small change. Our real data application considers hyperspectral images used for food quality detection. In these experiments the performance of the proposed method is either superior or on par with a standard approach such as principal component analysis.},

In remote sensing, class im-balance represents often a problem for tasks like land cover mapping, as small objects get less prioritised in an effort to achieve the best overall accuracy. We propose a novel ap-proach to achieve high overall accuracy, while still achiev-ing good accuracy for small objects. Quantifying the uncer-tainty on a pixel scale is another challenge in remote sens-ing, especially when using CNNs. In this paper we use re-cent advances in measuring uncertainty for CNNs and eval-uate their quality both qualitatively and quantitatively in a remote sensing context. We demonstrate our ideas on differ-ent deep architectures including patch-based and so-called pixel-to-pixel approaches, as well as their combination, by classifying each pixel in a set of aerial images covering Vai-hingen, Germany. The results show that we obtain an over-all classification accuracy of 87%. The corresponding F1-score for the small object class " car " is 80.6%, which is higher than state-of-the art for this dataset.},

 abstract = {Autoencoders learn data representations (codes) in such a way that the input is reproduced at the output of the network. However, it is not always clear what kind of properties of the input data need to be captured by the codes. Kernel machines have experienced great success by operating via inner-products in a theoretically well-defined reproducing kernel Hilbert space, hence capturing topological properties of input data. In this paper, we enhance the autoencoder's ability to learn effective data representations by aligning inner products between codes with respect to a kernel matrix. By doing so, the proposed kernelized autoencoder allows learning similarity-preserving embeddings of input data, where the notion of similarity is explicitly controlled by the user and encoded in a positive semi-definite kernel matrix. Experiments are performed for evaluating both reconstruction and kernel alignment performance in classification tasks and visualization of high-dimensional data. Additionally, we show that our method is capable to emulate kernel principal component analysis on a denoising task, obtaining competitive results at a much lower computational cost.},

The density ridge framework for estimating principal curves and surfaces has in a number of recent works been shown to capture manifold structure in data in an intuitive and effective manner. However, to date there exists no efficient way to traverse these manifolds as defined by density ridges. This is unfortunate, as manifold traversal is an important problem for example for shape estimation in medical imaging, or in general for being able to characterize and understand state transitions or local variability over the data manifold. In this paper, we remedy this situation by introducing a novel manifold traversal algorithm based on geodesics within the density ridge approach. The traversal is executed in a subspace capturing the intrinsic dimensionality of the data using dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis or kernel entropy component analysis. A mapping back to the ambient space is obtained by training a neural network. We compare against maximum mean discrepancy traversal, a recent approach, and obtain promising results.},

 abstract = {Automatic urban land cover classification is a fundamental problem in remote sensing, e.g. for environmental monitoring. The problem is highly challenging, as classes generally have high inter-class and low intra-class variance. Techniques to improve urban land cover classification performance in remote sensing include fusion of data from different sensors with different data modalities. However, such techniques require all modalities to be available to the classifier in the decision-making process, i.e. at test time, as well as in training. If a data modality is missing at test time, current state-of-the-art approaches have in general no procedure available for exploiting information from these modalities. This represents a waste of potentially useful information. We propose as a remedy a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for urban land cover classification which is able to embed all available training modalities in a so-called hallucination network. The network will in effect replace missing data modalities in the test phase, enabling fusion capabilities even when data modalities are missing in testing. We demonstrate the method using two datasets consisting of optical and digital surface model (DSM) images. We simulate missing modalities by assuming that DSM images are missing during testing. Our method outperforms both standard CNNs trained only on optical images as well as an ensemble of two standard CNNs. We further evaluate the potential of our method to handle situations where only some DSM images are missing during testing. Overall, we show that we can clearly exploit training time information of the missing modality during testing.},

 abstract = {Salient segmentation aims to segment out attention-grabbing regions, a critical yet challenging task and the foundation of many high-level computer vision applications. It requires semantic-aware grouping of pixels into salient regions and benefits from the utilization of global multi-scale contexts to achieve good local reasoning. Previous works often address it as two-class segmentation problems utilizing complicated multi-step procedures including refinement networks and complex graphical models. We argue that semantic salient segmentation can instead be effectively resolved by reformulating it as a simple yet intuitive pixel-pair based connectivity prediction task. Following the intuition that salient objects can be naturally grouped via semantic-aware connectivity between neighboring pixels, we propose a pure Connectivity Net (ConnNet). ConnNet predicts connectivity probabilities of each pixel with its neighboring pixels by leveraging multi-level cascade contexts embedded in the image and long-range pixel relations. We investigate our approach on two tasks, namely salient object segmentation and salient instance-level segmentation, and illustrate that improvements can be obtained by modeling these tasks as connectivity instead of binary segmentation tasks. We achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming or being comparable to existing approaches while reducing training time due to our less complex approach.},

 abstract = {Convolutional neural networks have led to significant breakthroughs in the domain of medical image analysis. However, the task of breast cancer segmentation in whole-slide images (WSIs) is still underexplored. WSIs are large histopathological images with extremely high resolution. Constrained by the hardware and field of view, using high-magnification patches can slow down the inference process and using low-magnification patches can cause the loss of information. In this paper, we aim to achieve two seemingly conflicting goals for breast cancer segmentation: accurate and fast prediction. We propose a simple yet efficient framework Reinforced Auto-Zoom Net (RAZN) to tackle this task. Motivated by the zoom-in operation of a pathologist using a digital microscope, RAZN learns a policy network to decide whether zooming is required in a given region of interest. Because the zoom-in action is selective, RAZN is robust to unbalanced and noisy ground truth labels and can efficiently reduce overfitting. We evaluate our method on a public breast cancer dataset. RAZN outperforms both single-scale and multi-scale baseline approaches, achieving better accuracy at low inference cost.},

Our work targets this query-conditioned video summarization task, by first proposing a Mapping Network (MapNet) in order to express how related a shot is to a given query. MapNet helps establish the relation between the two different modalities (videos and query), which allows mapping of visual information to query space. After that, a deep reinforcement learning-based summarization network (SummNet) is developed to provide personalized summaries by integrating relatedness, representativeness and diversity rewards. These rewards jointly guide the agent to select the most representative and diversity video shots that are most related to the user query. Experimental results on a query-conditioned video summarization benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, indicating the usefulness of the proposed mapping mechanism as well as the reinforcement learning approach.&lt;/p&gt;},

Our contribution to this emerging field is a new deep clustering network that leverages the discriminative power of information-theoretic divergence measures, which have been shown to be effective in traditional clustering. We propose a novel loss function that incorporates geometric regularization constraints, thus avoiding degenerate structures of the resulting clustering partition.

Manual measurement of CTR is time-consuming and can be affected by human subjectivity, making it desirable to design computer-aided systems that assist clinicians in the diagnosis process. Automatic CTR estimation through chest organ segmentation, however, requires large amounts of pixel-level annotated data, which is often unavailable. To alleviate this problem, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation framework based on adversarial networks. The framework learns domain invariant feature representations from openly available data sources to produce accurate chest organ segmentation for unlabeled datasets. Specifically, we propose a model that enforces our intuition that prediction masks should be domain independent. Hence, we introduce a discriminator that distinguishes segmentation predictions from ground truth masks. We evaluate our system's prediction based on the assessment of radiologists and demonstrate the clinical practicability for the diagnosis of cardiomegaly. We finally illustrate on the JSRT dataset that the semi-supervised performance of our model is also very promising.},

The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has shown promising results in different research domains, and it has been documented the powerful information embedded in the latent space of the VAE. We use the VAE and show that transforming the input data into a meaningful representation, it is possible to steer configurations in the latent space of the VAE. Specifically, the Weight of Evidence (WoE) transformation encapsulates the propensity to fall into financial distress and the latent space in the VAE preserves this characteristic in a well-defined clustering structure. These clusters have considerably different risk profiles and therefore are suitable not only for credit scoring but also for marketing and customer purposes. This new clustering methodology offers solutions to some of the challenges in the existing clustering algorithms, e.g., suggests the number of clusters, assigns cluster labels to new customers, enables cluster visualization, scales to large datasets, captures non-linear relationships among others. Finally, for portfolios with a large number of customers in each cluster, developing one classifier model per cluster can improve the credit scoring assessment.},

 abstract = {Learning data representations that reflect the customers' creditworthiness can improve marketing campaigns, customer relationship management, data and process management or the credit risk assessment in retail banks. In this research, we adopt the Variational Autoencoder (VAE), which has the ability to learn latent representations that contain useful information. We show that it is possible to steer the latent representations in the latent space of the VAE using the Weight of Evidence and forming a specific grouping of the data that reflects the customers' creditworthiness. Our proposed method learns a latent representation of the data, which shows a well-defied clustering structure capturing the customers' creditworthiness. These clusters are well suited for the aforementioned banks' activities. Further, our methodology generalizes to new customers, captures high-dimensional and complex financial data, and scales to large data sets.},

The proposed DDCM-Net consists of dense dilated convolutions merged with varying dilation rates. This can effectively enlarge the kernels' receptive fields, and, more importantly, obtain fused local and global context information to promote surrounding discriminative capability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DDCM-Net on the publicly available ISPRS Potsdam dataset and achieve a performance of 92.3% F1-score and 86.0% mean intersection over union accuracy by only using the RGB bands, without any post-processing. We also show results on the ISPRS Vaihingen dataset, where the DDCM-Net trained with IRRG bands, also obtained better mapping accuracy (89.8% F1-score) than previous state-of-the-art approaches.},

However, standardized QA protocols do not yet exist and the QA methods, as well as the applied tolerance levels, vary in scope and extent at different hospitals.PurposeTo propose a standardized protocol for acceptance and constancy testing of CT scanners in the Nordic Region.Material and MethodsFollowing a Nordic Association for Clinical Physics (NACP) initiative, a group of medical physicists, with representatives from four Nordic countries, was formed. Based on international literature and practical experience within the group, a comprehensive standardized test protocol was developed.ResultsThe proposed protocol includes tests related to the mechanical functionality, X-ray tube, detector, and image quality for CT scanners. For each test, recommendations regarding the purpose, equipment needed, an outline of the test method, the measured parameter, tolerance levels, and the testing frequency are stated. In addition, a number of optional tests are briefly discussed that may provide further information about the CT system.ConclusionBased on international references and medical physicists' practical experiences, a comprehensive QA protocol for CT systems is proposed, including both acceptance and constancy tests. The protocol may serve as a reference for medical physicists in the Nordic countries.},

 abstract = {Salient segmentation aims to segment out attention-grabbing regions, a critical yet challenging task and the foundation of many high-level computer vision applications. It requires semantic-aware grouping of pixels into salient regions and benefits from the utilization of global multi-scale contexts to achieve good local reasoning. Previous works often address it as two-class segmentation problems utilizing complicated multi-step procedures including refinement networks and complex graphical models. We argue that semantic salient segmentation can instead be effectively resolved by reformulating it as a simple yet intuitive pixel-pair based connectivity prediction task. Following the intuition that salient objects can be naturally grouped via semantic-aware connectivity between neighboring pixels, we propose a pure Connectivity Net (ConnNet). ConnNet predicts connectivity probabilities of each pixel with its neighboring pixels by leveraging multi-level cascade contexts embedded in the image and long-range pixel relations. We investigate our approach on two tasks, namely salient object segmentation and salient instance-level segmentation, and illustrate that improvements can be obtained by modeling these tasks as connectivity instead of binary segmentation tasks. We achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming or being comparable to existing approaches while reducing training time due to our less complex approach.},

 abstract = {Convolutional neural networks have led to significant breakthroughs in the domain of medical image analysis. However, the task of breast cancer segmentation in whole-slide images (WSIs) is still underexplored. WSIs are large histopathological images with extremely high resolution. Constrained by the hardware and field of view, using high-magnification patches can slow down the inference process and using low-magnification patches can cause the loss of information. In this paper, we aim to achieve two seemingly conflicting goals for breast cancer segmentation: accurate and fast prediction. We propose a simple yet efficient framework Reinforced Auto-Zoom Net (RAZN) to tackle this task. Motivated by the zoom-in operation of a pathologist using a digital microscope, RAZN learns a policy network to decide whether zooming is required in a given region of interest. Because the zoom-in action is selective, RAZN is robust to unbalanced and noisy ground truth labels and can efficiently reduce overfitting. We evaluate our method on a public breast cancer dataset. RAZN outperforms both single-scale and multi-scale baseline approaches, achieving better accuracy at low inference cost.},

 abstract = {The cardiothoracic ratio (CTR), a clinical metric of heart size in chest X-rays (CXRs), is a key indicator of cardiomegaly. Manual measurement of CTR is time-consuming and can be affected by human subjectivity, making it desirable to design computer-aided systems that assist clinicians in the diagnosis process. Automatic CTR estimation through chest organ segmentation, however, requires large amounts of pixel-level annotated data, which is often unavailable. To alleviate this problem, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation framework based on adversarial networks. The framework learns domain invariant feature representations from openly available data sources to produce accurate chest organ segmentation for unlabeled datasets. Specifically, we propose a model that enforces our intuition that prediction masks should be domain independent. Hence, we introduce a discriminator that distinguishes segmentation predictions from ground truth masks. We evaluate our system's prediction based on the assessment of radiologists and demonstrate the clinical practicability for the diagnosis of cardiomegaly. We finally illustrate on the JSRT dataset that the semi-supervised performance of our model is also very promising.},

 abstract = {The free text in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) conveys a huge amount of clinical information about health state and patient history. Despite a rapidly growing literature on the use of machine learning techniques for extracting this information, little effort has been invested towards feature selection and the features' corresponding medical interpretation. In this work, we focus on the task of early detection of anastomosis leakage (AL), a severe complication after elective surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery, using free text extracted from EHRs. We use a Bag-of-Words model to investigate the potential for feature selection strategies. The purpose is earlier detection of AL and prediction of AL with data generated in the EHR before the actual complication occur. Due to the high dimensionality of the data, we derive feature selection strategies using the robust support vector machine linear maximum margin classifier, by investigating: (a) a simple statistical criterion (leave-oneout based test); (b) an intensive-computation statistical criterion (Bootstrap resampling); and (c) an advanced statistical criterion (kernel entropy). Results reveal a discriminatory power for early detection of complications after CRC (sensitivity 100%; specificity 72%). These results can be used to develop prediction models, based on EHR data, that can support surgeons and patients in the preoperative decision making phase.},

The proposed DDCM-Net consists of dense dilated convolutions merged with varying dilation rates. This can effectively enlarge the kernels' receptive fields, and, more importantly, obtain fused local and global context information to promote surrounding discriminative capability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DDCM-Net on the publicly available ISPRS Potsdam dataset and achieve a performance of 92.3% F1-score and 86.0% mean intersection over union accuracy by only using the RGB bands, without any post-processing. We also show results on the ISPRS Vaihingen dataset, where the DDCM-Net trained with IRRG bands, also obtained better mapping accuracy (89.8% F1-score) than previous state-of-the-art approaches.},

 abstract = {Autoencoders learn data representations (codes) in such a way that the input is reproduced at the output of the network. However, it is not always clear what kind of properties of the input data need to be captured by the codes. Kernel machines have experienced great success by operating via inner-products in a theoretically well-defined reproducing kernel Hilbert space, hence capturing topological properties of input data. In this paper, we enhance the autoencoder's ability to learn effective data representations by aligning inner products between codes with respect to a kernel matrix. By doing so, the proposed kernelized autoencoder allows learning similarity-preserving embeddings of input data, where the notion of similarity is explicitly controlled by the user and encoded in a positive semi-definite kernel matrix. Experiments are performed for evaluating both reconstruction and kernel alignment performance in classification tasks and visualization of high-dimensional data. Additionally, we show that our method is capable to emulate kernel principal component analysis on a denoising task, obtaining competitive results at a much lower computational cost.},

 abstract = {© Springer International Publishing AG 2017. Change detection in heterogeneous multitemporal satellite images is a challenging and still not much studied topic in remote sensing and earth observation. This paper focuses on comparison of image pairs covering the same geographical area and acquired by two different sensors, one optical radiometer and one synthetic aperture radar, at two different times. We propose a clustering-based technique to detect changes, identified as clusters that split or merge in the different images. To evaluate potentials and limitations of our method, we perform experiments on real data. Preliminary results confirm the relationship between splits and merges of clusters and the occurrence of changes. However, it becomes evident that it is necessary to incorporate prior, ancillary, or application-specific information to improve the interpretation of clustering results and to identify unambiguously the areas of change.},

The method consists in projecting the output of the internal layer of the network on a space with lower dimensionality, before training the output layer to learn the target task. Notably, we enforce a regularization constraint that leads to better generalization capabilities. We evaluate the performances of our approach on several benchmark tests, using different techniques to train the readout of the network, achieving superior predictive performance when using the proposed framework. Finally, we provide an insight on the effectiveness of the implemented mechanics through a visualization of the trajectory in the phase space and relying on the methodologies of nonlinear time-series analysis. By applying our method on well known chaotic systems, we provide evidence that the lower dimensional embedding retains the dynamical properties of the underlying system better than the full-dimensional internal states of the network.},

In this paper we present a novel clustering approach which combines two modern strategies, namely consensus clustering, and two stage clustering as represented by the mean shift spectral clustering algorithm. We introduce the recent kNN mode seeking algorithm in the consensus clustering framework, and the information theoretic kNN Cauchy Schwarz divergence as foundation for spectral clustering. In combining these frameworks, two well known problematic issues are directly bypassed; the kernel bandwidth choice of the kernel density based mean shift and the computational complexity of the mean shift iterations. We demonstrate experiments on both real and synthetic data as a proof of concept for our contributions.},

Mode seeking, especially in the form of the mean shift algorithm, is a widely used strategy for clustering data, but at the same time prone to poor performance if the parameters are not chosen correctly. We propose to form a clustering ensemble consisting of repeated and bootstrapped runs of the recent kNN mode seeking algorithm, an algorithm which is faster than ordinary mean shift and more suited for high dimensional data. This creates a robust mode seeking clustering algorithm with respect to the choice of parameters and high dimensional input spaces, while at the same inheriting all other strengths of mode seeking in general. We demonstrate promising results on a number of synthetic and real data sets.},

In this paper, we develop and evaluate recent advances in uncertainty estimation and model interpretability in the context of semantic segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images. We evaluate and enhance several architectures of Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) for semantic segmentation of colorectal polyps and provide a comparison between these models.

 abstract = {Identifying customer segments in retail banking portfolios with different risk profiles can improve the accuracy of credit scoring. The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has shown promising results in different research domains, and it has been documented the powerful information embedded in the latent space of the VAE. We use the VAE and show that transforming the input data into a meaningful representation, it is possible to steer configurations in the latent space of the VAE. Specifically, the Weight of Evidence (WoE) transformation encapsulates the propensity to fall into financial distress and the latent space in the VAE preserves this characteristic in a well-defined clustering structure. These clusters have considerably different risk profiles and therefore are suitable not only for credit scoring but also for marketing and customer purposes. This new clustering methodology offers solutions to some of the challenges in the existing clustering algorithms, e.g., suggests the number of clusters, assigns cluster labels to new customers, enables cluster visualization, scales to large datasets, captures non-linear relationships among others. Finally, for portfolios with a large number of customers in each cluster, developing one classifier model per cluster can improve the credit scoring assessment.},

 abstract = {© Springer International Publishing AG 2017. Change detection in heterogeneous multitemporal satellite images is a challenging and still not much studied topic in remote sensing and earth observation. This paper focuses on comparison of image pairs covering the same geographical area and acquired by two different sensors, one optical radiometer and one synthetic aperture radar, at two different times. We propose a clustering-based technique to detect changes, identified as clusters that split or merge in the different images. To evaluate potentials and limitations of our method, we perform experiments on real data. Preliminary results confirm the relationship between splits and merges of clusters and the occurrence of changes. However, it becomes evident that it is necessary to incorporate prior, ancillary, or application-specific information to improve the interpretation of clustering results and to identify unambiguously the areas of change.},

However, many such methods rely on parameter tuning, and some have shortcomings if the time series are multivariate (MTS), due to dependencies between attributes, or the time series contain missing data. In this paper, we address these challenges within the powerful context of kernel methods by proposing the robust time series cluster kernel (TCK). The approach taken leverages the missing data handling properties of Gaussian mixture models (GMM) augmented with informative prior distributions. An ensemble learning approach is exploited to ensure robustness to parameters by combining the clustering results of many GMM to form the final kernel. We evaluate the TCK on synthetic and real data and compare to other state-of-the-art techniques. The experimental results demonstrate that the TCK is robust to parameter choices, provides competitive results for MTS without missing data and outstanding results for missing data.},

In combining these frameworks, two well known problematic issues are directly bypassed; the kernel bandwidth choice of the kernel density based mean shift and the computational complexity of the mean shift iterations.

 abstract = {Noisy labeled data represent a rich source of information that often are easily accessible and cheap to obtain, but label noise might also have many negative consequences if not accounted for. How to fully utilize noisy labels has been studied extensively within the framework of standard supervised machine learning over a period of several decades. However, very little research has been conducted on solving the challenge posed by noisy labels in non-standard settings. This includes situations where only a fraction of the samples are labeled (semi-supervised) and each high-dimensional sample is associated with multiple labels. In this work, we present a novel semi-supervised and multi-label dimensionality reduction method that effectively utilizes information from both noisy multi-labels and unlabeled data. With the proposed Noisy multi-label semi-supervised dimensionality reduction (NMLSDR) method, the noisy multi-labels are denoised and unlabeled data are labeled simultaneously via a specially designed label propagation algorithm. NMLSDR then learns a projection matrix for reducing the dimensionality by maximizing the dependence between the enlarged and denoised multi-label space and the features in the projected space. Extensive experiments on synthetic data, benchmark datasets, as well as a real-world case study, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art multi-label feature extraction algorithms.},

 abstract = {The free text in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) conveys a huge amount of clinical information about health state and patient history. Despite a rapidly growing literature on the use of machine learning techniques for extracting this information, little effort has been invested towards feature selection and the features' corresponding medical interpretation. In this work, we focus on the task of early detection of anastomosis leakage (AL), a severe complication after elective surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery, using free text extracted from EHRs. We use a Bag-of-Words model to investigate the potential for feature selection strategies. The purpose is earlier detection of AL and prediction of AL with data generated in the EHR before the actual complication occur. Due to the high dimensionality of the data, we derive feature selection strategies using the robust support vector machine linear maximum margin classifier, by investigating: (a) a simple statistical criterion (leave-oneout based test); (b) an intensive-computation statistical criterion (Bootstrap resampling); and (c) an advanced statistical criterion (kernel entropy). Results reveal a discriminatory power for early detection of complications after CRC (sensitivity 100%; specificity 72%). These results can be used to develop prediction models, based on EHR data, that can support surgeons and patients in the preoperative decision making phase.},

 abstract = {© Springer International Publishing AG 2017. Change detection in heterogeneous multitemporal satellite images is a challenging and still not much studied topic in remote sensing and earth observation. This paper focuses on comparison of image pairs covering the same geographical area and acquired by two different sensors, one optical radiometer and one synthetic aperture radar, at two different times. We propose a clustering-based technique to detect changes, identified as clusters that split or merge in the different images. To evaluate potentials and limitations of our method, we perform experiments on real data. Preliminary results confirm the relationship between splits and merges of clusters and the occurrence of changes. However, it becomes evident that it is necessary to incorporate prior, ancillary, or application-specific information to improve the interpretation of clustering results and to identify unambiguously the areas of change.},

In this paper we present a novel clustering approach which combines two modern strategies, namely consensus clustering, and two stage clustering as represented by the mean shift spectral clustering algorithm. We introduce the recent kNN mode seeking algorithm in the consensus clustering framework, and the information theoretic kNN Cauchy Schwarz divergence as foundation for spectral clustering. In combining these frameworks, two well known problematic issues are directly bypassed; the kernel bandwidth choice of the kernel density based mean shift and the computational complexity of the mean shift iterations. We demonstrate experiments on both real and synthetic data as a proof of concept for our contributions.},

 abstract = {© 2017 IEEE. The density ridge framework for estimating principal curves and surfaces has in a number of recent works been shown to capture manifold structure in data in an intuitive and effective manner. However, to date there exists no efficient way to traverse these manifolds as defined by density ridges. This is unfortunate, as manifold traversal is an important problem for example for shape estimation in medical imaging, or in general for being able to characterize and understand state transitions or local variability over the data manifold. In this paper, we remedy this situation by introducing a novel manifold traversal algorithm based on geodesics within the density ridge approach. The traversal is executed in a subspace capturing the intrinsic dimensionality of the data using dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis or kernel entropy component analysis. A mapping back to the ambient space is obtained by training a neural network. We compare against maximum mean discrepancy traversal, a recent approach, and obtain promising results.},

 abstract = {Two classical multivariate statistical problems, testing of multivariate normality and the k-sample problem, are explored by a novel analysis on several resolutions simultaneously. The presented methods do not invert any estimated covariance matrix. Thereby, the methods work in the High Dimension Low Sample Size situation, i.e. when n p. The output, a significance map, is produced by doing a one-dimensional test for all possible resolution/ position pairs. The significance map shows for which resolution/position pairs the null hypothesis is rejected. For the testing of multinormality, the Anderson-Darling test is utilized to detect potential departures from multinormality at different combinations of resolutions and positions. In the k-sample case, it is tested whether k data sets can be said to originate from the same unspecified discrete or continuous multivariate distribution. This is done by testing the k vectors corresponding to the same resolution/position pair of the k different data sets through the k-sample Anderson-Darling test. Successful demonstrations of the new methodology on artificial and real data sets are presented, and a feature selection scheme is demonstrated.},

 abstract = {Physical activities have a significant impact on blood glucose homeostasis of patients with type 1 diabetes. Regular physical exercise provides many proven health benefits and is recommended as part of a healthy lifestyle. However, one of the main side effects of physical activities is hypoglycemia (low blood glucose). Fear of hypoglycemia generally leads to the patients not participating in physical activities. This paper shows a proof of concept that machine learning can be used to create a personalized food recommendation system for patients with type 1 diabetes. Machine learning algorithms were designed to improve glycemic control and reduce the overcompensation of carbohydrate. First, a personalized model based on feedforward neural networks is developed to predict the blood glucose outcome during and after physical activities. Based on the personalized model and reinforcement learning, optimal food intakes will be recommended to the patient. Simulation results show that the proposed methodology has successfully maintained the blood glucose in the healthy range on a type 1 diabetes simulator during physical activities.},

 abstract = {To maintain the reliability, availability, and sustainability of electricity supply, electricity companies regularly perform visual inspections on their transmission and distribution networks. These inspections have been typically carried out using foot patrol and/or helicopter-assisted methods to plan for necessary repair or replacement works before any major damage, which may cause power outage. This solution is quite slow, expensive, and potentially dangerous. In recent years, numerous researches have been conducted to automate the visual inspections by using automated helicopters, flying robots, and/or climbing robots. However, due to the high accuracy requirements of the task and its unique challenges, automatic vision-based inspection has not been widely adopted. In this paper, with the aim of providing a good starting point for researchers who are interested in developing a fully automatic autonomous vision-based power line inspection system, we conduct an extensive literature review. First, we examine existing power line inspection methods with special attention paid to highlight their advantages and disadvantages. Next, we summarize well-suited tasks and review potential data sources for automatic vision-based inspection. Then, we survey existing automatic vision-based power line inspection systems. Based on that, we propose a new automatic autonomous vision-based power line inspection concept that uses Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) inspection as the main inspection method, optical images as the primary data source, and deep learning as the backbone of data analysis and inspection. Then, we present an overview of possibilities and challenges of deep vision (deep learning for computer vision) approaches for both UAV navigation and UAV inspection and discuss possible solutions to the challenges. Finally, we conclude the paper with an outlook for the future of this field and propose potential next steps for implementing the concept.},

Mode seeking, especially in the form of the mean shift algorithm, is a widely used strategy for clustering data, but at the same time prone to poor performance if the parameters are not chosen correctly. We propose to form a clustering ensemble consisting of repeated and bootstrapped runs of the recent kNN mode seeking algorithm, an algorithm which is faster than ordinary mean shift and more suited for high dimensional data. This creates a robust mode seeking clustering algorithm with respect to the choice of parameters and high dimensional input spaces, while at the same inheriting all other strengths of mode seeking in general. We demonstrate promising results on a number of synthetic and real data sets.},

 abstract = {Two classical multivariate statistical problems, testing of multivariate normality and the k-sample problem, are explored by a novel analysis on several resolutions simultaneously. The presented methods do not invert any estimated covariance matrix. Thereby, the methods work in the High Dimension Low Sample Size situation, i.e. when n p. The output, a significance map, is produced by doing a one-dimensional test for all possible resolution/ position pairs. The significance map shows for which resolution/position pairs the null hypothesis is rejected. For the testing of multinormality, the Anderson-Darling test is utilized to detect potential departures from multinormality at different combinations of resolutions and positions. In the k-sample case, it is tested whether k data sets can be said to originate from the same unspecified discrete or continuous multivariate distribution. This is done by testing the k vectors corresponding to the same resolution/position pair of the k different data sets through the k-sample Anderson-Darling test. Successful demonstrations of the new methodology on artificial and real data sets are presented, and a feature selection scheme is demonstrated.},

 abstract = {Physical activities have a significant impact on blood glucose homeostasis of patients with type 1 diabetes. Regular physical exercise provides many proven health benefits and is recommended as part of a healthy lifestyle. However, one of the main side effects of physical activities is hypoglycemia (low blood glucose). Fear of hypoglycemia generally leads to the patients not participating in physical activities. This paper shows a proof of concept that machine learning can be used to create a personalized food recommendation system for patients with type 1 diabetes. Machine learning algorithms were designed to improve glycemic control and reduce the overcompensation of carbohydrate. First, a personalized model based on feedforward neural networks is developed to predict the blood glucose outcome during and after physical activities. Based on the personalized model and reinforcement learning, optimal food intakes will be recommended to the patient. Simulation results show that the proposed methodology has successfully maintained the blood glucose in the healthy range on a type 1 diabetes simulator during physical activities.},

 abstract = {Given an object of interest that evolves in time, one often wants to detect possible changes in its properties. The first changes may be small and occur in different scales and it may be crucial to detect them as early as possible. Examples include identification of potentially malignant changes in skin moles or the gradual onset of food quality deterioration. Statistical scale-space methodologies can be very useful in such situations since exploring the measurements in multiple resolutions can help identify even subtle changes. We extend a recently proposed scale-space methodology to a technique that successfully detects such small changes and at the same time keeps false alarms at a very low level. The potential of the novel methodology is first demonstrated with hyperspectral skin mole data artificially distorted to include a very small change. Our real data application considers hyperspectral images used for food quality detection. In these experiments the performance of the proposed method is either superior or on par with a standard approach such as principal component analysis.},

 abstract = {In recent years there has been a growing interest in clustering methods stemming from the spectral decomposition of the data affinity matrix, which are shown to present good results on a wide variety of situations. However, a complete theoretical understanding of these methods in terms of data distributions is not yet well understood. In this paper, we propose a spectral clustering based mode merging method for mean shift as a theoretically well-founded approach that enables a probabilistic interpretation of affinity based clustering through kernel density estimation. This connection also allows principled kernel optimization and enables the use of anisotropic variable-size kernels to match local data structures. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm's performance on image segmentation applications and compare its clustering results with the well-known Mean Shift and Normalized Cut algorithms. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {Using information theoretic concepts to understand and explore the inner organization of deep neural networks (DNNs) remains a big challenge. Recently, the concept of an information plane (coupled with the famed information bottleneck principle) began to shed light on the analysis of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). We provided an in-depth insight into stacked autoencoders (SAEs) using a novel matrix-based Renyi's \alpha-entropy functional, enabling for the first time the analysis of the dynamics of learning using information flow in the real-world scenario involving complex network architecture and large data. Despite the great potential of these past works, there are several open questions when it comes to applying information theoretic concepts to understand convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These include for instance the accurate estimation of information quantities among multiple variables, and the many different training methodologies. By extending the novel matrix-based Renyi's \alpha-entropy functional to a multivariate scenario and introducing the partial information decomposition (PID) framework, this paper presents a systematic method to analyze CNNs training using information theory. Our results validate two fundamental data processing inequalities in CNNs, and also reveals some fundamental issues embedded in the training phase of CNNs.},

 abstract = {To maintain the reliability, availability, and sustainability of electricity supply, electricity companies regularly perform visual inspections on their transmission and distribution networks. These inspections have been typically carried out using foot patrol and/or helicopter-assisted methods to plan for necessary repair or replacement works before any major damage, which may cause power outage. This solution is quite slow, expensive, and potentially dangerous. In recent years, numerous researches have been conducted to automate the visual inspections by using automated helicopters, flying robots, and/or climbing robots. However, due to the high accuracy requirements of the task and its unique challenges, automatic vision-based inspection has not been widely adopted. In this paper, with the aim of providing a good starting point for researchers who are interested in developing a fully automatic autonomous vision-based power line inspection system, we conduct an extensive literature review. First, we examine existing power line inspection methods with special attention paid to highlight their advantages and disadvantages. Next, we summarize well-suited tasks and review potential data sources for automatic vision-based inspection. Then, we survey existing automatic vision-based power line inspection systems. Based on that, we propose a new automatic autonomous vision-based power line inspection concept that uses Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) inspection as the main inspection method, optical images as the primary data source, and deep learning as the backbone of data analysis and inspection. Then, we present an overview of possibilities and challenges of deep vision (deep learning for computer vision) approaches for both UAV navigation and UAV inspection and discuss possible solutions to the challenges. Finally, we conclude the paper with an outlook for the future of this field and propose potential next steps for implementing the concept.},

 abstract = {We propose a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for land cover mapping in remote sensing images, with a focus on urban areas. In remote sensing, class im-balance represents often a problem for tasks like land cover mapping, as small objects get less prioritised in an effort to achieve the best overall accuracy. We propose a novel ap-proach to achieve high overall accuracy, while still achiev-ing good accuracy for small objects. Quantifying the uncer-tainty on a pixel scale is another challenge in remote sens-ing, especially when using CNNs. In this paper we use re-cent advances in measuring uncertainty for CNNs and eval-uate their quality both qualitatively and quantitatively in a remote sensing context. We demonstrate our ideas on differ-ent deep architectures including patch-based and so-called pixel-to-pixel approaches, as well as their combination, by classifying each pixel in a set of aerial images covering Vai-hingen, Germany. The results show that we obtain an over-all classification accuracy of 87%. The corresponding F1-score for the small object class " car " is 80.6%, which is higher than state-of-the art for this dataset.},

 abstract = {Automatic urban land cover classification is a fundamental problem in remote sensing, e.g. for environmental monitoring. The problem is highly challenging, as classes generally have high inter-class and low intra-class variance. Techniques to improve urban land cover classification performance in remote sensing include fusion of data from different sensors with different data modalities. However, such techniques require all modalities to be available to the classifier in the decision-making process, i.e. at test time, as well as in training. If a data modality is missing at test time, current state-of-the-art approaches have in general no procedure available for exploiting information from these modalities. This represents a waste of potentially useful information. We propose as a remedy a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for urban land cover classification which is able to embed all available training modalities in a so-called hallucination network. The network will in effect replace missing data modalities in the test phase, enabling fusion capabilities even when data modalities are missing in testing. We demonstrate the method using two datasets consisting of optical and digital surface model (DSM) images. We simulate missing modalities by assuming that DSM images are missing during testing. Our method outperforms both standard CNNs trained only on optical images as well as an ensemble of two standard CNNs. We further evaluate the potential of our method to handle situations where only some DSM images are missing during testing. Overall, we show that we can clearly exploit training time information of the missing modality during testing.},

As opposed to supervised deep learning, this line of research is in its infancy, and how to design and optimize suitable loss functions to train deep neural networks for clustering is still an open question. Our contribution to this emerging field is a new deep clustering network that leverages the discriminative power of information-theoretic divergence measures, which have been shown to be effective in traditional clustering. We propose a novel loss function that incorporates geometric regularization constraints, thus avoiding degenerate structures of the resulting clustering partition. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real datasets show that the proposed network achieves competitive performance with respect to other state-of-the-art methods, scales well to large datasets, and does not require pre-training steps.},

The proposed DDCM-Net consists of dense dilated convolutions merged with varying dilation rates. This can effectively enlarge the kernels' receptive fields, and, more importantly, obtain fused local and global context information to promote surrounding discriminative capability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DDCM-Net on the publicly available ISPRS Potsdam dataset and achieve a performance of 92.3% F1-score and 86.0% mean intersection over union accuracy by only using the RGB bands, without any post-processing. We also show results on the ISPRS Vaihingen dataset, where the DDCM-Net trained with IRRG bands, also obtained better mapping accuracy (89.8% F1-score) than previous state-of-the-art approaches.},

Change detection in heterogeneous multitemporal satellite images is a challenging and still not much studied topic in remote sensing and earth observation. This paper focuses on comparison of image pairs covering the same geographical area and acquired by two different sensors, one optical radiometer and one synthetic aperture radar, at two different times. We propose a clustering-based technique to detect changes, identified as clusters that split or merge in the different images. To evaluate potentials and limitations of our method, we perform experiments on real data. Preliminary results confirm the relationship between splits and merges of clusters and the occurrence of changes. However, it becomes evident that it is necessary to incorporate prior, ancillary, or application-specific information to improve the interpretation of clustering results and to identify unambiguously the areas of change.},

 abstract = {The free text in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) conveys a huge amount of clinical information about health state and patient history. Despite a rapidly growing literature on the use of machine learning techniques for extracting this information, little effort has been invested towards feature selection and the features' corresponding medical interpretation. In this work, we focus on the task of early detection of anastomosis leakage (AL), a severe complication after elective surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery, using free text extracted from EHRs. We use a Bag-of-Words model to investigate the potential for feature selection strategies. The purpose is earlier detection of AL and prediction of AL with data generated in the EHR before the actual complication occur. Due to the high dimensionality of the data, we derive feature selection strategies using the robust support vector machine linear maximum margin classifier, by investigating: (a) a simple statistical criterion (leave-oneout based test); (b) an intensive-computation statistical criterion (Bootstrap resampling); and (c) an advanced statistical criterion (kernel entropy). Results reveal a discriminatory power for early detection of complications after CRC (sensitivity 100%; specificity 72%). These results can be used to develop prediction models, based on EHR data, that can support surgeons and patients in the preoperative decision making phase.},

 abstract = {Similarity-based approaches represent a promising direction for time series analysis. However, many such methods rely on parameter tuning, and some have shortcomings if the time series are multivariate (MTS), due to dependencies between attributes, or the time series contain missing data. In this paper, we address these challenges within the powerful context of kernel methods by proposing the robust time series cluster kernel (TCK). The approach taken leverages the missing data handling properties of Gaussian mixture models (GMM) augmented with informative prior distributions. An ensemble learning approach is exploited to ensure robustness to parameters by combining the clustering results of many GMM to form the final kernel. We evaluate the TCK on synthetic and real data and compare to other state-of-the-art techniques. The experimental results demonstrate that the TCK is robust to parameter choices, provides competitive results for MTS without missing data and outstanding results for missing data.},

 abstract = {The free text in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) conveys a huge amount of clinical information about health state and patient history. Despite a rapidly growing literature on the use of machine learning techniques for extracting this information, little effort has been invested towards feature selection and the features' corresponding medical interpretation. In this work, we focus on the task of early detection of anastomosis leakage (AL), a severe complication after elective surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery, using free text extracted from EHRs. We use a Bag-of-Words model to investigate the potential for feature selection strategies. The purpose is earlier detection of AL and prediction of AL with data generated in the EHR before the actual complication occur. Due to the high dimensionality of the data, we derive feature selection strategies using the robust support vector machine linear maximum margin classifier, by investigating: (a) a simple statistical criterion (leave-oneout based test); (b) an intensive-computation statistical criterion (Bootstrap resampling); and (c) an advanced statistical criterion (kernel entropy). Results reveal a discriminatory power for early detection of complications after CRC (sensitivity 100%; specificity 72%). These results can be used to develop prediction models, based on EHR data, that can support surgeons and patients in the preoperative decision making phase.},

 abstract = {Noisy labeled data represent a rich source of information that often are easily accessible and cheap to obtain, but label noise might also have many negative consequences if not accounted for. How to fully utilize noisy labels has been studied extensively within the framework of standard supervised machine learning over a period of several decades. However, very little research has been conducted on solving the challenge posed by noisy labels in non-standard settings. This includes situations where only a fraction of the samples are labeled (semi-supervised) and each high-dimensional sample is associated with multiple labels. In this work, we present a novel semi-supervised and multi-label dimensionality reduction method that effectively utilizes information from both noisy multi-labels and unlabeled data. With the proposed Noisy multi-label semi-supervised dimensionality reduction (NMLSDR) method, the noisy multi-labels are denoised and unlabeled data are labeled simultaneously via a specially designed label propagation algorithm. NMLSDR then learns a projection matrix for reducing the dimensionality by maximizing the dependence between the enlarged and denoised multi-label space and the features in the projected space. Extensive experiments on synthetic data, benchmark datasets, as well as a real-world case study, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art multi-label feature extraction algorithms.},

particular set of challenges, namely to adequately model temporal relations and
variable sequence lengths. If these challenges are not properly handled, the
resulting clusters might be of suboptimal quality. As a key solution, we
present a joint clustering and feature learning framework for time series based
on deep learning. For a given set of time series, we train a recurrent network
to represent, or embed, each time series in a vector space such that a
divergence-based clustering loss function can discover the underlying cluster
structure in an end-to-end manner. Unlike previous approaches, our model
inherently handles multivariate time series of variable lengths and does not
require specification of a distance-measure in the input space. On a diverse
set of benchmark datasets we illustrate that our proposed Recurrent Deep
Divergence-based Clustering approach outperforms, or performs comparable to,
previous approaches.

 abstract = {Foraminifera are single-celled marine organisms, which may have a planktic or benthic lifestyle. During their life cycle they construct shells consisting of one or more chambers, and these shells remain as fossils in marine sediments. Classifying and counting these fossils have become an important tool in e.g. oceanography and climatology. Currently the process of identifying and counting microfossils is performed manually using a microscope and is very time consuming. Developing methods to automate this process is therefore considered important across a range of research fields. The first steps towards developing a deep learning model that can detect and classify microscopic foraminifera are proposed. The proposed model is based on a VGG16 model that has been pretrained on the ImageNet dataset, and adapted to the foraminifera task using transfer learning. Additionally, a novel image dataset consisting of microscopic foraminifera and sediments from the Barents Sea region is introduced.},

Thus it can be tailored to different user interests leading to a better personalized summary and differs from the generic video summarization which only focuses on video content. Our work targets this query-conditioned video summarization task, by first proposing a Mapping Network (MapNet) in order to express how related a shot is to a given query. MapNet helps establish the relation between the two different modalities (videos and query), which allows mapping of visual information to query space. After that, a deep reinforcement learning-based summarization network (SummNet) is developed to provide personalized summaries by integrating relatedness, representativeness and diversity rewards. These rewards jointly guide the agent to select the most representative and diversity video shots that are most related to the user query. Experimental results on a query-conditioned video summarization benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, indicating the usefulness of the proposed mapping mechanism as well as the reinforcement learning approach.&lt;/p&gt;},

 abstract = {Two classical multivariate statistical problems, testing of multivariate normality and the k-sample problem, are explored by a novel analysis on several resolutions simultaneously. The presented methods do not invert any estimated covariance matrix. Thereby, the methods work in the High Dimension Low Sample Size situation, i.e. when n p. The output, a significance map, is produced by doing a one-dimensional test for all possible resolution/ position pairs. The significance map shows for which resolution/position pairs the null hypothesis is rejected. For the testing of multinormality, the Anderson-Darling test is utilized to detect potential departures from multinormality at different combinations of resolutions and positions. In the k-sample case, it is tested whether k data sets can be said to originate from the same unspecified discrete or continuous multivariate distribution. This is done by testing the k vectors corresponding to the same resolution/position pair of the k different data sets through the k-sample Anderson-Darling test. Successful demonstrations of the new methodology on artificial and real data sets are presented, and a feature selection scheme is demonstrated.},

 abstract = {Physical activities have a significant impact on blood glucose homeostasis of patients with type 1 diabetes. Regular physical exercise provides many proven health benefits and is recommended as part of a healthy lifestyle. However, one of the main side effects of physical activities is hypoglycemia (low blood glucose). Fear of hypoglycemia generally leads to the patients not participating in physical activities. This paper shows a proof of concept that machine learning can be used to create a personalized food recommendation system for patients with type 1 diabetes. Machine learning algorithms were designed to improve glycemic control and reduce the overcompensation of carbohydrate. First, a personalized model based on feedforward neural networks is developed to predict the blood glucose outcome during and after physical activities. Based on the personalized model and reinforcement learning, optimal food intakes will be recommended to the patient. Simulation results show that the proposed methodology has successfully maintained the blood glucose in the healthy range on a type 1 diabetes simulator during physical activities.},

 abstract = {&lt;p&gt;The task of clustering unlabeled time series and sequences entails a
particular set of challenges, namely to adequately model temporal relations and
variable sequence lengths. If these challenges are not properly handled, the
resulting clusters might be of suboptimal quality. As a key solution, we
present a joint clustering and feature learning framework for time series based
on deep learning. For a given set of time series, we train a recurrent network
to represent, or embed, each time series in a vector space such that a
divergence-based clustering loss function can discover the underlying cluster
structure in an end-to-end manner. Unlike previous approaches, our model
inherently handles multivariate time series of variable lengths and does not
require specification of a distance-measure in the input space. On a diverse
set of benchmark datasets we illustrate that our proposed Recurrent Deep
Divergence-based Clustering approach outperforms, or performs comparable to,
previous approaches.

 abstract = {Given an object of interest that evolves in time, one often wants to detect possible changes in its properties. The first changes may be small and occur in different scales and it may be crucial to detect them as early as possible. Examples include identification of potentially malignant changes in skin moles or the gradual onset of food quality deterioration. Statistical scale-space methodologies can be very useful in such situations since exploring the measurements in multiple resolutions can help identify even subtle changes. We extend a recently proposed scale-space methodology to a technique that successfully detects such small changes and at the same time keeps false alarms at a very low level. The potential of the novel methodology is first demonstrated with hyperspectral skin mole data artificially distorted to include a very small change. Our real data application considers hyperspectral images used for food quality detection. In these experiments the performance of the proposed method is either superior or on par with a standard approach such as principal component analysis.},

 abstract = {Convolutional neural networks have led to significant breakthroughs in the domain of medical image analysis. However, the task of breast cancer segmentation in whole-slide images (WSIs) is still underexplored. WSIs are large histopathological images with extremely high resolution. Constrained by the hardware and field of view, using high-magnification patches can slow down the inference process and using low-magnification patches can cause the loss of information. In this paper, we aim to achieve two seemingly conflicting goals for breast cancer segmentation: accurate and fast prediction. We propose a simple yet efficient framework Reinforced Auto-Zoom Net (RAZN) to tackle this task. Motivated by the zoom-in operation of a pathologist using a digital microscope, RAZN learns a policy network to decide whether zooming is required in a given region of interest. Because the zoom-in action is selective, RAZN is robust to unbalanced and noisy ground truth labels and can efficiently reduce overfitting. We evaluate our method on a public breast cancer dataset. RAZN outperforms both single-scale and multi-scale baseline approaches, achieving better accuracy at low inference cost.},

 abstract = {The cardiothoracic ratio (CTR), a clinical metric of heart size in chest X-rays (CXRs), is a key indicator of cardiomegaly. Manual measurement of CTR is time-consuming and can be affected by human subjectivity, making it desirable to design computer-aided systems that assist clinicians in the diagnosis process. Automatic CTR estimation through chest organ segmentation, however, requires large amounts of pixel-level annotated data, which is often unavailable. To alleviate this problem, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation framework based on adversarial networks. The framework learns domain invariant feature representations from openly available data sources to produce accurate chest organ segmentation for unlabeled datasets. Specifically, we propose a model that enforces our intuition that prediction masks should be domain independent. Hence, we introduce a discriminator that distinguishes segmentation predictions from ground truth masks. We evaluate our system's prediction based on the assessment of radiologists and demonstrate the clinical practicability for the diagnosis of cardiomegaly. We finally illustrate on the JSRT dataset that the semi-supervised performance of our model is also very promising.},

 abstract = {Salient segmentation aims to segment out attention-grabbing regions, a critical yet challenging task and the foundation of many high-level computer vision applications. It requires semantic-aware grouping of pixels into salient regions and benefits from the utilization of global multi-scale contexts to achieve good local reasoning. Previous works often address it as two-class segmentation problems utilizing complicated multi-step procedures including refinement networks and complex graphical models. We argue that semantic salient segmentation can instead be effectively resolved by reformulating it as a simple yet intuitive pixel-pair based connectivity prediction task. Following the intuition that salient objects can be naturally grouped via semantic-aware connectivity between neighboring pixels, we propose a pure Connectivity Net (ConnNet). ConnNet predicts connectivity probabilities of each pixel with its neighboring pixels by leveraging multi-level cascade contexts embedded in the image and long-range pixel relations. We investigate our approach on two tasks, namely salient object segmentation and salient instance-level segmentation, and illustrate that improvements can be obtained by modeling these tasks as connectivity instead of binary segmentation tasks. We achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming or being comparable to existing approaches while reducing training time due to our less complex approach.},

 abstract = {Convolutional neural networks have led to significant breakthroughs in the domain of medical image analysis. However, the task of breast cancer segmentation in whole-slide images (WSIs) is still underexplored. WSIs are large histopathological images with extremely high resolution. Constrained by the hardware and field of view, using high-magnification patches can slow down the inference process and using low-magnification patches can cause the loss of information. In this paper, we aim to achieve two seemingly conflicting goals for breast cancer segmentation: accurate and fast prediction. We propose a simple yet efficient framework Reinforced Auto-Zoom Net (RAZN) to tackle this task. Motivated by the zoom-in operation of a pathologist using a digital microscope, RAZN learns a policy network to decide whether zooming is required in a given region of interest. Because the zoom-in action is selective, RAZN is robust to unbalanced and noisy ground truth labels and can efficiently reduce overfitting. We evaluate our method on a public breast cancer dataset. RAZN outperforms both single-scale and multi-scale baseline approaches, achieving better accuracy at low inference cost.},

 abstract = {The cardiothoracic ratio (CTR), a clinical metric of heart size in chest X-rays (CXRs), is a key indicator of cardiomegaly. Manual measurement of CTR is time-consuming and can be affected by human subjectivity, making it desirable to design computer-aided systems that assist clinicians in the diagnosis process. Automatic CTR estimation through chest organ segmentation, however, requires large amounts of pixel-level annotated data, which is often unavailable. To alleviate this problem, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation framework based on adversarial networks. The framework learns domain invariant feature representations from openly available data sources to produce accurate chest organ segmentation for unlabeled datasets. Specifically, we propose a model that enforces our intuition that prediction masks should be domain independent. Hence, we introduce a discriminator that distinguishes segmentation predictions from ground truth masks. We evaluate our system's prediction based on the assessment of radiologists and demonstrate the clinical practicability for the diagnosis of cardiomegaly. We finally illustrate on the JSRT dataset that the semi-supervised performance of our model is also very promising.},

 abstract = {Given an object of interest that evolves in time, one often wants to detect possible changes in its properties. The first changes may be small and occur in different scales and it may be crucial to detect them as early as possible. Examples include identification of potentially malignant changes in skin moles or the gradual onset of food quality deterioration. Statistical scale-space methodologies can be very useful in such situations since exploring the measurements in multiple resolutions can help identify even subtle changes. We extend a recently proposed scale-space methodology to a technique that successfully detects such small changes and at the same time keeps false alarms at a very low level. The potential of the novel methodology is first demonstrated with hyperspectral skin mole data artificially distorted to include a very small change. Our real data application considers hyperspectral images used for food quality detection. In these experiments the performance of the proposed method is either superior or on par with a standard approach such as principal component analysis.},

 abstract = {Salient segmentation aims to segment out attention-grabbing regions, a critical yet challenging task and the foundation of many high-level computer vision applications. It requires semantic-aware grouping of pixels into salient regions and benefits from the utilization of global multi-scale contexts to achieve good local reasoning. Previous works often address it as two-class segmentation problems utilizing complicated multi-step procedures including refinement networks and complex graphical models. We argue that semantic salient segmentation can instead be effectively resolved by reformulating it as a simple yet intuitive pixel-pair based connectivity prediction task. Following the intuition that salient objects can be naturally grouped via semantic-aware connectivity between neighboring pixels, we propose a pure Connectivity Net (ConnNet). ConnNet predicts connectivity probabilities of each pixel with its neighboring pixels by leveraging multi-level cascade contexts embedded in the image and long-range pixel relations. We investigate our approach on two tasks, namely salient object segmentation and salient instance-level segmentation, and illustrate that improvements can be obtained by modeling these tasks as connectivity instead of binary segmentation tasks. We achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming or being comparable to existing approaches while reducing training time due to our less complex approach.},

However, standardized QA protocols do not yet exist and the QA methods, as well as the applied tolerance levels, vary in scope and extent at different hospitals.PurposeTo propose a standardized protocol for acceptance and constancy testing of CT scanners in the Nordic Region.Material and MethodsFollowing a Nordic Association for Clinical Physics (NACP) initiative, a group of medical physicists, with representatives from four Nordic countries, was formed. Based on international literature and practical experience within the group, a comprehensive standardized test protocol was developed.ResultsThe proposed protocol includes tests related to the mechanical functionality, X-ray tube, detector, and image quality for CT scanners. For each test, recommendations regarding the purpose, equipment needed, an outline of the test method, the measured parameter, tolerance levels, and the testing frequency are stated. In addition, a number of optional tests are briefly discussed that may provide further information about the CT system.ConclusionBased on international references and medical physicists' practical experiences, a comprehensive QA protocol for CT systems is proposed, including both acceptance and constancy tests. The protocol may serve as a reference for medical physicists in the Nordic countries.},

Mode seeking, especially in the form of the mean shift algorithm, is a widely used strategy for clustering data, but at the same time prone to poor performance if the parameters are not chosen correctly. We propose to form a clustering ensemble consisting of repeated and bootstrapped runs of the recent kNN mode seeking algorithm, an algorithm which is faster than ordinary mean shift and more suited for high dimensional data. This creates a robust mode seeking clustering algorithm with respect to the choice of parameters and high dimensional input spaces, while at the same inheriting all other strengths of mode seeking in general. We demonstrate promising results on a number of synthetic and real data sets.},
